# 👋 Hi, I'm Khoerunnisa!

I'm an aspiring **Front-End Developer** who recently transitioned from admin work to the world of web development. I love turning simple ideas into clean, functional, and user-friendly websites.

Currently focusing on:
- 🔤 HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla)
- 🔧 Building real-world projects (SPA, notes app, CV site)
- 🚀 Preparing for my first opportunity in tech!
